Notes:

Algorithm: A set of steps or instructions for completing a task.
Properties:
1. Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output.
2. The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.
3. The steps also need to be distinct.
4. The algorithm should produce a result.
5. The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.

Two Important Property We need:
1. Correctness: Algorithm should produce output for given input.
2. Efficiency: There are 2 way to measure Efficiency.

[1] Time complexity: How long algorithm takes to complete.
> Big O : Theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.
- It is just a notation used describe the complexity.
- Order of magnitude of complexity. (Function of the size)
- Upper Bounds.

[2] Space complexity: How much space algorithm takes to perform.(Memory)

Searching Algorithms:
1. Linear Search (Sequenciel Search)
> Big O : O(n)
> Linear runtine
2. Binary Search
> Big O : O(log n)
> Logarithmic runtime (Sub-linear runtime)

> Inverse of exponent is called logarithm.

1. Linear Algorithms        > O(n)
2. Binary Algorithms        > O(log n)
3. Quadratic Algorithms     > O(n ^ 2)
4. Quasilinear Algorithms   > O(n log n)

> Polynomial Runtime Algorithms         > O(n ^ k)
- They are efficient and can be used in practice.

> Exponential Runtime Algorithms        > O(x ^ n)
> Factorial / Combinatorial Algorithms  > O(n!)
- They are inefficient and can'be used in practice.
Example :
1. Brute Force attack to crack the password.
2. Travelling Salesman problem.

> Recursive Algorithms and complexity
Binary Search : Iterative Approach
- Space complexity : O(1) - constant space
Recursive Binary Search : Recursive Approach
- Space complexity : O(Log n) - Logarithmic space

- Python prefers iterative approach
- The numbers of times recursive function calls it self is called recursive depth.
- After some recursive depth the python might stop calling itself because it has reached it's recursive depth.

> Tail Optimization/Tail Call Optmization:
- If function is having a head and tail.
- If the recursive function call is the last line of code in the function, then we call this a tail recursion.
- Language like Swift stores the last recursive call into storage that is called tail opmization.
- Now python doesn't provide this tail optimization that's why the recursive approach will take some space.
- That's why for recursive approach of binary search the python will take logarithmic space complexity while other language which support optimization may take less space complexity or constant space complexity.
- So while implementation of algorithms we can take programming language into account.
